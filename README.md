# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 — C++ Solutions

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**, all written in **C++**.  
Advent of Code is a yearly programming challenge that runs throughout December, offering a new puzzle every day.  
This repo is my way of practicing problem-solving, exploring new patterns, and having fun with C++.

---

## 🚀 About This Repository

- All solutions are implemented using **C++ (C++17 or newer)**.  
- Each day's solution is placed in a separate file (e.g., `Day1_Part1.cpp`).  
- Code style leans toward clarity first, performance second.

## 🛠️ Compiling & Running

Typical compilation using **g++**:

```bash
g++ Day1_Part1.cpp -o Day1_Part1
./Day1_Part1
```
